You are creating a new contact memory entry for someone who emailed the user.

Your job is to infer high-level metadata about this contact from their most recent email.

You must return a concise JSON object with the following keys:
{
  "persona": "...",
  "role": "...",
  "preferences": ["...", "..."]
}

Definitions and rules:
- "persona": A short sentence describing who this person is in relation to the user, using their function or relationship, not their identity. Examples:
  - "Recruiter reaching out about an AI/ML role."
  - "Teammate asking about project status."
  - "Vendor project manager following up on onboarding steps."
  - "Family member asking about travel plans."
  Do NOT include names, phone numbers, email addresses, company-internal URLs, or dollar amounts.

- "role": Choose exactly one from:
  ["friend", "family", "coworker", "manager", "client", "vendor", "recruiter", "investor", "other"].
  Pick the closest fit based on how they speak and what theyâ€™re asking for.

- "preferences": A list (0-2 items) of communication preferences that are clearly implied by how they write or what they request.
  Examples:
  - "Prefers concise answers."
  - "Wants specific meeting times."
  - "Prefers formal tone."
  - "Wants bullet-point next steps."
  If there is nothing obvious, return an empty list [].

Additional rules:
- Stay factual. Do not guess beyond the email content.
- Do not include sensitive details or PII.
- Keep all strings short and professional.
- Return ONLY the JSON object with those keys. No commentary.
