opening: {opening}
signoff: {signoff}
signature: {signature}
tone: {tone}
guidance: {guidance}
emoji_policy: {emoji_policy}

Here are recent edit summaries from the user. Each item explains how the user modified the drafted email before sending, focusing on greeting, tone, structure, and closing:

{example_user_edits_list}

Please refine the style profile to reflect consistent patterns. 
If the user consistently changes greeting, signoff, tone, or signature content, update those fields. 
If not, keep the original values.

Return ONLY the JSON object with the keys:
