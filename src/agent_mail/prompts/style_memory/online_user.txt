Below is the model-generated draft:

---
{model_generated_text}

Below is the user’s final edited version that was actually sent:

---
{user_final_text}

Here are the existing stored style edit summaries for this style profile:
{example_user_edits_list}

Compare the model draft and the final version.
Describe ONLY how the user changed:
- greeting / opening
- tone or formality
- structure (e.g. added apology first, shortened, added bullets)
- signoff / closing phrase
- signature block style (e.g. first name vs full name, added role line)

Do NOT include:
- phone numbers
- email addresses
- URLs / calendar links
- dollar amounts
- internal project or company code names

Produce 1–3 NEW short summaries (≤ 25 words each) that capture any *new* style behaviors not already in the stored edit summaries.

Return ONLY the JSON object specified.
